## 🎨 Creating a Component

1. Inside your react application directory, right click the folder where you want to create your component, like this: <img src=".github/assets/csPreview1.gif" />

2. Then, give your component a name. What you type is going to be trimmed, capitalized and spaces will be removed. <img src=".github/assets/csPreview2.gif" />

3. And just like that your react component is created with a spec and a style file to go with it! <img src=".github/assets/csPreview3.gif" />

**Notes:**

- This example shows the creation of a next.js component. The only difference is that you don't need to import react.
- You can also run this extension from the command palette: type `crate a react component` or `crate a next component`.
